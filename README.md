# Growth Mindset

I feel first and foremost having the right mindset, one of *curiousity* and *adaptability*, is crucial to any type of success. I strive to learn and grow in any endeavor I try. I don't always succeed, but I do always "stay the course" and keep trying.

>    “A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,” (Dweck, 2014).

Things I will challenge myself in this area are:
* Always be prepared
* Clarity on what is expected of me
* Be open-minded
