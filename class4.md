# Read 4 Structure Web pages with HTML

## Wireframes

Wireframing is a practice used by designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

## Semantics

In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example *what effect does running that line of HTML have?*, or *what purpose or role does that HTML element have* (rather than *what does it look like?*)

HTML should be coded to **represent** the data that will be populated and **not** based on its default presentation styling.

### Examples

* footer
* header
* main
* nav
* section
