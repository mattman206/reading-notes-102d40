# Read 5 Design Web Pages with CSS

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

## How does it look in action?

CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.

### Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* **External CSS**
* **Internal CSS**
* **Inline CSS**

> With an external style sheet, you can change the look  of an entire website by changing just one file!
> An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
> The internal style is defined inside the `style` element, inside the head section.
> An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
> To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the    relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
