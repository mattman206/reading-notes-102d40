# Git conclusions

When learning Git, one must get across this idea that our files are *distributed* across multiple machines, and that changing it on one of them will (eventually) change it on the others. It is terrifying when you realize that you could have multiple - possibly way too many - people working on the same codebase at the same time. That's why it is so important to understand this process. Always **over commit**, **push on every commit**, and **pull before any merge/pull request/new branch/etc** (and maybe before you start working each day just for fun).
