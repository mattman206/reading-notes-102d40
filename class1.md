# Growth Mindset

I feel first and foremost having the right mindset, one of *curiousity* and *adaptability*, is crucial to any type of success. I strive to learn and grow in any endeavor I try. I don't always succeed, but I do always "stay the course" and keep trying.

> “A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,” (Dweck, 2014).

Things I will challenge myself in this area are:

* Always be prepared
* Clarity on what is expected of me
* Be open-minded

## Read-1 Learning Markdown

### Markdown syntax

Markdown's syntax is intended to be used as a format for *writing* for the web.
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is
*not* to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. The idea for Markdown is to make it
easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing* format. Thus, Markdown's formatting syntax only addresses issues
that can be conveyed in plain text.
