## Read-1 Learning Markdown

### Markdown syntax:
Markdown's syntax is intended to be used as a format for *writing* for the web.
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is
*not* to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. The idea for Markdown is to make it
easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing* format. Thus, Markdown's formatting syntax only addresses issues
that can be conveyed in plain text.
